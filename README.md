# PneumoniaComputerVision
Kaggle dataset machine vision application

I found a pneumonia x-ray dataset on Kaggle and decided to tackle the problem with tensorflow/keras neural networks. Due to the size of the dataset,
I have added the folder to .gitignore. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
